- The project focused on the creation and normalisation of a data model for the management of video game events developed by Arkkane Studios. The initial dataset contained redundant and dispersed information about games, genres, platforms, developers, and publishers, which led to the need to reorganise the tables to reduce redundancy and improve the efficiency of data management.

- During the modelling process, new entities were identified and created that allowed for a cleaner and more organised data structure. Primary keys (PK) were generated for each entity and foreign keys (FK) were established to define the relationships between them, thus ensuring the referential integrity of the data model. The model was designed to correctly handle multi-publisher game cases, as well as one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between the different entities.

- Sales relationships specific to consoles such as Xbox and PS4 were modelled to reflect how a single video game could have multiple versions sold on different platforms, thus capturing the market behaviour of game franchises.

- The report highlighted the importance of eliminating transitive dependencies and improving standardisation to optimise information access and management, avoiding duplication and ensuring that each piece of data is stored in the most logical and efficient place within the schema.

- The project provided a detailed and functional data model that facilitates the management of video game-related information, enabling the company to make more informed decisions and effectively manage its operations related to the digital entertainment industry.
